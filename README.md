# Basic-Sales-Summary-Using-SQLite-and-Python

This shows how I connected Python with a SQLite database to create a simple sales table, run SQL queries, and generate basic data summaries. I used pandas to load SQL results and visualized product-wise revenue using a matplotlib bar chart. This helped me practice SQL inside Python, database handling, and basic data visualization.
